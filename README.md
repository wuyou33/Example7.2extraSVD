# Example7.2extraSVD
Degradation of the Riccati equation observational updates with SVD-based KF

These two codes should be used with the codes of Chapter 7 of the celebrated book [1]. Example 7.2 (see also Figure 7.1) illustrates the degradation of the Riccati equation observational updates with problem conditioning. We incorporated our recent SVD-based KF implementation [2] into the book codes.
